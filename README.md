A simple Flask web application that allows users to fill out and submit a job application form.

📝 Collects applicant details (name, email, skills, experience, etc.)

💾 Stores submissions (in memory / database, depending on setup)

🌐 Built with Flask to demonstrate backend web development

🎨 Can be extended with HTML/CSS for a better user experience

This project highlights my ability to build web applications with Python Flask, handle form submissions, and structure clean, reusable code.
